Grassroots Letter to Official 

Dear Mr. Mallard

417 House Office Building
402 South Monroe St

Tallahassee, FL 32399-1300

 

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing because there is a cause I care about that I feel needs to be addressed in our communities. 
This cause is people stealing photocards out of kpop albums. 

Because this cause means so much to me, Iâ€™ve decided to write to address some concerns I have, and some recommendations of changes I believe can be made to enhance the cause I care about.


First off, let's start off with the why. Why are people stealing photocards? The reason people do this is for a piece of paper. A piece of paper of a kpop idol. A piece of paper of a kpop idol doing nothing. These pieces of paper are very valuable to some people. So why steal them?

This is where everything falls apart. Most kpop stans are broke. The age range is wide, but even in this wide range, people are somehow still broke. I blame inflation for this. Although I know you probably don't have direct contact to someone who could do something about inflation, can you please get to the bottom of this? I just wanna buy a <a href=https://twice.jype.com/>TWICE</a> album without worrying about anything being stolen.

So please, think of something to fix this. I have already made a few solutions.

<b>1. Put a child lock on these albums<b> since these fans don't know any better and acting like children.

<b>2. Ask stores to put albums in the back.<b> having albums on display is one of the many reasons why photocards are being stolen. 

<b>3. Seal the albums with a harder to rip through plastic.<b> The albums come lightly sealed, especially compact versions. By putting a material harder to rip through it serves maximum protection.

Thank you!
 

 

 

Sincerely, 

Dylan W
